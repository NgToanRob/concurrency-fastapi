# Guide to Start Compose and Run Tests

To get started with composing and running tests using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose: Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system. You can download and install them from the official Docker website.

2. Create a Docker Compose file: In your project directory, create a file named `docker-compose.yml`. This file will define the services and configurations for your test environment.

3. Define your services: Inside the `docker-compose.yml` file, define the services you need for your tests. This can include your application container, database container, and any other dependencies. Specify the image, ports, volumes, and other configurations for each service.

4. Build and start the containers: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project directory, and run the following command to build and start the containers:

    ```
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

    This command will build the images and start the containers defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

5. Run your tests: Once the containers are up and running, you can execute your tests. Open another terminal or command prompt window, navigate to your project directory, and run the following command:

    ```
    python test/bench.py
    ```

6. View test results: After running the tests, you can view the test results in the terminal or command prompt window. The output will show the status and details of each test.

7. Stop and clean up: Once you are done with the tests, you can stop and clean up the containers. In the terminal or command prompt window where you started the containers, press `Ctrl+C` to stop the containers. Then, run the following command to remove the containers:

    ```
    docker-compose down
    ```

    This command will stop and remove the containers defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

That's it! You have now successfully composed and run tests using Docker Compose. Happy testing!
